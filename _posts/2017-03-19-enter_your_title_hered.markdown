I am a student who majors in computer science in Korea. Ever since childhood, I have dreamed of working abroad, because Korea seems too small for me.

I took a trip alone to Sydney for 3 week. I met various people during the trip. And I realized that I was a person who has a narrow view toward the world and my life. Every person I've met told me her or his own stories that I've never heard. Sometimes, those were about relationships, death, life, or herself. Even I met an engineer working at Google. He told me his life as a developer. Thanks to the trip and those people who I met, I could broaden my perspective and feel my life deeper. And this trip reminded me of my dream - Go abroad! Live overseas! 

Soon after returning to Korea, I started to find some ways. As I major in computer science, I thought becoming a professional programmer is one of the ways to go abroad. I confess that I was not a hard-working student. So I needed some way to make me study. I reviewed various curricula in Korea, but those were not enough. Thanks to my friend who let me know flatiron, I appled for it, and I was fortunate enough to receive a scholarship(Women-in-tech).

So, yes. There was a chance and I took it. Soon I'm gonna change the world with my arms.
