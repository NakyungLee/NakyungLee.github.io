My first CLI gem project.

1. Why I choosed this topic
Maybe some of you know - or at least heard - about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, which is used as a currency in real world. You can even buy a pizza with it. [Click if you are interested.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2013/12/23/the-bitcoin-pizza-purchase-thats-worth-7-million-today/#53c300642509)(You could have bought pizza paying 10000bit.)
Now, the rate is now over $1200 to 1Bit! And day by day, there comes a lot more cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Ripple, etc.
And there are trading centers for cryptocurrencies, so that we can buy and sell our coins. People make profit by trading them, like stock trading. 
Actually, I am one of them. And I needed charts I can use. So I made it. (Frankly, there is API.)


2. How I designed my code

When brainstorming, I watched video links learn.co provided.

And I designed my code like above.

3. Results and Review

Actually, I didn't read the instruction page very well, so I didn't make git repostiory when I started programming. I pushed it when I'm almost done. Of course, I couldn't took a video. These are the worst mistake that I've made this year.
And I realized that designing code is way more harder than programming. Before this project, all I had to do was to pass the test. I didn't have to watch the forest, so I just followed trees. I should practice how to design projects from now on.
