My First Sinatra Project.

**Motivation**

We often tell that Books are the chicken soup for the soul. However, nowadays, with the development of iPhone, we read less.
So I started to think the way to read "well", because I believe high quality(of reading) can complement the low quantity.
To improve the quality, we should write, leave a record, share and add comments about what we've read.

Yes. I've made [Your Own Library](https://github.com/NakyungLee/my-own-library) for these reasons.

**Functions**
1. Signup/Login/Logout : You can enroll yourself, just as you do in other webs.

2. Add Books : After you login, you can have your own Library, so that you can add/edit/delete books and comments.

3. Look Around All Books : not only books you've enrolled, you can also watch others' books. However, you cannot edit/delete.

4.  Quotes : This page gathers all sentences and comments users have wrote.

**Future Plans**
I think I should modify edit pages, like below.
